# Distributed Systems for Data Engineering

This project demonstrates building a blog submission form using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, deploying it with **Docker and AWS ECS**, and integrating **Agentic AI with Ollama**. The HTML form validates inputs such as blog content length and terms acceptance, while the JavaScript handles JSON conversion, object destructuring, spread operators, and closures. Deployment is shown through Docker containers and hosting on AWS ECS. The second part explores running lightweight local LLMs with Ollama (`smollm:1.7b`, `Phi3:mini`) and a Python script (`agents_demo.py`) to demonstrate a multi-agent workflow (Planner, Reviewer, Finalizer). The final outputs include blog content, generated tags, refined summaries, and a publishable package, showcasing the integration of **web development, containerization, cloud deployment, and AI agents**.
